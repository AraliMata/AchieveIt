## Inspiration
When generating ideas, we realised that many people have been demotivated to work out or stride towards their goals during corona virus lock-downs, the idea was that bringing in competition from your group of friends or colleagues would help boost your productivity..
## What it does
Tracks the progress of your group's activity towards a goal and check the global leader-board too for any given goal. It gives the user the flexibility to form the groups with the people they want to so that the users are not overwhelmed by others achievements.
## How we built it
We built the app using flutter and firebase real-time database.
## Challenges we ran into
We were all new to flutter so it was a challenge to learn quickly.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Managing to complete the project in such tough timezone differences and learning and adapting a language was definitely a challenge.
